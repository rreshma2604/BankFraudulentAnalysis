# BankFraudulentAnalysis
In order to design a fault detection system, three sample datasets are provided. We must  extract data from the given datasets: transaction.txt, fraud-description.txt, and description.txt. The first dataset (description.txt) comprises genuine transaction descriptions. The description  of fraudulent transactions can be found in the second dataset (fraud-description.txt) and the  actual transactions (10,000) data are contained in the last dataset (transaction.txt). The transaction dataset contains information about the transactions, such as their descriptions,  amounts, and locations. The location is just Euclidean coordinates in x and y points. The attributes of transaction dataset (transaction.txt) are: userID, transactionID, transaction description, transaction amount, each transaction's x coordinate, each transaction's y  coordinate and a Boolean label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent.
